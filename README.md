## About
I've created some modular Sass (SCSS) parts to create custom window bar gradients and scalable UIs. 

In order to display multiple sketches, I converted my sketches to instance mode and used [p5-global2instance](https://github.com/DrSensor/p5-global2instance), but unfortunately it hasn't been updated in a long time - so there was a lot I had to do manually.
